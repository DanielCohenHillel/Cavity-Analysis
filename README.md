# Cavity Analysis
Analysis of the transmon-cavity system used in our lab.

## Half vs Full
Comparison of a half Tesla cavity to a full Tesla cavity. Checking for quality factors, life-times and dissipation using both a volume
integral method (modeling the dirt as a 3D object) and surface integral method (integrting the surface of the cavity to analyze the dirt).

## Coupling
Analysis of the copuling between the transom and the readout strip-line.
